# Fault-tolerant key/value storage system

## Inspiring
- This is a series of labs in which I'll build a fault-tolerant key/value storage system.
- In the current version, I've implemented Raft - a replicated state machine protocol from scratch follow by Raft paper. It includes leader election, replicate log, save persistent state and read it after a node fail/restart, and log compaction.
- This is also a project where I practice coding in a new language - Golang.
